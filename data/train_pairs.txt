Engine blade crack inspection is important | Fatigue cracks in turbine blades must be detected early
Borescope inspection checks turbine internals | Internal engine inspection using borescope
Predictive maintenance reduces failures | Machine learning predicts engine component failures
Ultrasonic testing detects cracks | Non-destructive inspection identifies blade defects
